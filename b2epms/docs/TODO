*	Work on the search function, which quit paginating the results after
	the upgrade to Apache2. (I have added a limited search function that
	will allow you to search by user without any pagination).

*	Add additional search capabilities: date, sender, caller.

* 	Work on the capability to allow login to check messages marked as
	private.

*	Way more than I can possibly describe here yet.

*	Make the installer create the database.

*	Add a check to the new user creation to make sure that the user doesn't
	already exist.
