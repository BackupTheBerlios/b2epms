Currently there is only a rudimentary installation system for b2ePMS. All that
it will do is create your database tables and your administrator. The
installation system does not create a database, you must do that prior to
following these instructions.

Installation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Untar/bunzip the file b2epms-x.x.tar.bz2 into your web directory:

	tar xvfj b2epms-x.x.tar.bz2

	This will create a directory called b2epms-x.x. You can move/rename
	this directory to whatever you want or put its subdirectories/files
	under the root web directory.

2.	Point your web browser to http://where_you_put_b2epms/install/. Fill
	in the required blanks for the Database and Administrator and click
	"Install Now".

3.	Assuming everything turned up successful, Click on the "Admin Center"
	link and proceed with creating your users.

4.	Open includes/common.inc and modify to reflect your site.

5.	IMPORTANT! Be sure to delete the entire install directory, otherwise
	your message system will not work.

Currently there is no facility for modifying anything about the page layout
including headers and footers. If you have gotten this far you should be
able to modify those by hand. Eventually the Administration system
will handle the editing of the files you had to modify by hand.
