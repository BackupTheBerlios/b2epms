b2ePMS stands for Browser to Email Phone Message System. It is intended to
replace the standard paper/carbon phone message slips commonly used in offices,
with the capability of sending the message via a web browser form directly to
the recipients inbox. b2ePMS will have the capability to run searches based on
date, recipient, caller, and message sender. The capability to have messages
marked as private, so that only the sender and recipient have access to that 
message is also planned.

This software is in a beta testing state, and should be treated as such. If you
choose to test/use b2ePMS, you do so at your own risk. I will not be
responsible if you get hacked, destroy data, or if your computer explodes. No
security auditing has been done on b2ePMS as of yet! All of that being said,
this system is currently running on a production system in our office without
a hiccup for 6 months now.

BUT, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

b2ePMS requires a Linux server running Apache/PHP/MySQL and a functioning
mailserver. I test/develop on Ubuntu 5.10 using Apache 2.0.54, PHP 5.0.5, and
MySQL 4.0.24. If you get b2ePMS working under a different OS/version, please
let me know. If it doesn't work with your system, let me know about that too. I
may not do anything about it, but then again who knows :-). If you get b2ePMS
working on a system that it had problems on, please send the code and I will
try to get it incorporated into the next release (along with your name in the
contributors/developers list).
